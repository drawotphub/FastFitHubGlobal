   Google Account

Sign in with a supported browser

   To help protect your account, Google doesn’t let you sign in
   from some browsers. Google might stop sign-ins from browsers
   that:
     * Don’t support JavaScript or have JavaScript turned off
     * Have unsecure or unsupported extensions added
     * Are being controlled through software automation rather
       than a human
     * Are embedded in a different application

Step 1. Use a supported browser

   These and other browsers support JavaScript:
     * Chrome
     * Safari
     * Firefox
     * Opera
     * Edge

Step 2. Turn on JavaScript in Chrome

   If you use a supported browser and still can’t sign in, you
   might need to turn on JavaScript.
    1. On your computer, open Chrome.
    2. At the top right, click More More and then Settings.
    3. At the bottom, click Advanced.
    4. Under "Privacy and security," click Site Settings and
       then Javascript.
    5. Turn on the setting.

   Tip: You can turn off JavaScript after you sign in.

Turn on JavaScript in other browsers

   If you use a supported browser other than Chrome, check its
   support page for instructions on how to turn on JavaScript.
   If you’re not sure whether your browser supports JavaScript,
   check its support page.

Fix problems when you sign in

   Turn off extensions in Chrome
   If you still can’t sign in, it might be because you have
   unsecure or unsupported extensions turned on. Learn how to
   turn off extensions. You can turn on extensions again once
   you’ve signed in.
   Tip: If you use a different browser, check its support page
   for how to turn off extensions.
   Update your browser
   Some old browser versions might not be supported. Learn how
   to update Google Chrome.
   Tip: If you use a different browser, visit its support page
   to learn how to update it.
   Check your privacy settings

   If you use a browser other than Chrome and have set your
   browser’s privacy settings to “High” or “Strict,” you may
   need to add www.google.com to your browser’s list of allowed
   sites.

   Visit your browser’s support page for how to check your
   privacy settings.
   Check for security programs

   If you use a firewall, proxy, or anti-virus program,
   temporarily turn off the program. Then try to sign in to your
   Google Account.

   If that fixes the problem, the security program might have
   stopped you from using your Google Account. To use their
   program with Google access, contact the program's support
   page.
   If you use a work computer
   Ask your administrator about your company’s security
   settings.

Information for app developers

   If you implemented "Sign in with Google" with the Chromium
   Embedded Framework, you’ll need to migrate to a more secure
   alternative:
     * Switch to use browser-based OAuth.
     * Migrate your desktop app to a Progressive Web App.
